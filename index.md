# [UQ4Covid](/)

UQ4Covid is a coordinated national (UK) effort on uncertainty quantification
(UQ) for spatio-temporal epidemiological modelling of Covid-19 spread. 

The project brings together epidemiologists and statisticians to translate the
output of high-resolution computer models into policy-relevant decisions, with
emphasis on the inherent uncertainties due to computer simulations and
incomplete medical data.


## [Vignettes](vignettes)

At the moment this project consists mainly of a rapidly growing list of R
[vignettes](vignettes) which document in detail the various steps in uncertainty
quantification using state of the art methodology.


## [Glossary](uq-glossary)
